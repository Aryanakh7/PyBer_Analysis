# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

The purpose of the analysis is to identify how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. The generated data also shows the differences in Urban, Suburban and Rural Areas, and how this impacts the fare amount and revenue generated by drivers.

## Analysis Results 

As shown below, there is wide difference between the different city types:

The Urban area has more rides, total drivers, and total fares than the Suburban and Rural areas combined. Despite this, the average fare by ride and the average fare per driver have the lowest amount of the three city types. 
This could be explained by the availability of the ridesharing application in Urban and more concentrated areas, which makes ridesharing more popular and more available. 
In Suburban and rural areas where the population could be less concentrated, the total rides will decrease because fewer people will use ridesharing. As a result, the average fare price is likely to increase.

Other factors to consider include the area density and other transportation methods in Rural areas. If ridesharing is not the main method used for transportation, and there are other ways of transportation such as trains, cars and, bicycles, ridesharing is likely to be less popular and an option often overlooked for a seemingly more used transportation method.

Overall, the Urban area has the highest total fare for different months of the year, followed by the Suburban area and finally by the Rural area, which has the lowest total fares for the months of the year.

The Urban area is the most profitable of the three city types, despite having the lowest average fare per Ride and average fare per Driver.


## Recommendations

Based on the results above, three recommendations can be provided to the CEO:

- The different transportation methods in both the Suburban and Rural city types have to be researched to determine the reason behind the lower number of total rides and therefore total fares. 

- Creating a marketing strategy to advertise ridesharing as an integral part important to daily activities could increase PyBerâ€™s popularity in Suburban and Rural areas and consequently reduce the disparity between the Urban city type and the Rural and Suburban city types.

- Increasing the traveling route and areas covered in Suburban and Rural city types as well as providing adequate training to qualified drivers regarding safety and regulations, would provide more exposure to PyBer and maintain the quality standards of the Urban city type.
